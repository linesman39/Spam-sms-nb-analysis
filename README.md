# 📡 SMS Spam Detector: Battle of the Naives
_Comparing the performance of Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes for SMS spam detection_

Welcome to a showdown of simplicity and stats! This project pits **Multinomial** vs **Bernoulli** Naive Bayes to determine which model better sniffs out spam from legit SMS messages. Spoiler: the results might surprise you. 😉

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

📂 **/data**  
Real-world SMS messages labeled as _spam_ or _ham_, ready for classification carnage.

📓 **/notebooks**  
- `1_data_exploration.ipynb` – Meet the data  
- `2_preprocessing.ipynb` – Tokenizing and vectorizing  
- `3_model_multinomial.ipynb` – Multinomial NB: The word-count king  
- `4_model_bernoulli.ipynb` – Bernoulli NB: Binary and proud  

📊 **/results**  
Confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and head-to-head comparisons!

## 🧠 Why Naive Bayes?

Because sometimes "naive" is all you need. These models are:
- Fast 🏃‍♂️  
- Lightweight 🪶  
- Surprisingly effective for NLP tasks ✨
